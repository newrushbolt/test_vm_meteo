# Disclaimer

This plugin has been tested with Grafana 6.4, 7.x and 8.x but there's still
work to do before submitting to Grafana. New versions may require changes to
the query or configuration.

# Usage

Install:

```sh
$ sudo su -
# cd /var/lib/grafana/plugins
# git clone https://github.com/spectraphilic/grafana-windrose.git
```

Allow loading this plugin, in ``/etc/grafana/grafana.ini``:

```
[plugins]
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = spectraphilic-windrose-panel
```

Restart Grafana service.

Example query for PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT
  time,
  field1 AS speed,
  field2 AS direction
FROM table
WHERE $__unixEpochFilter("time")
ORDER BY time
```

Example for ClickHouse:

```sql
SELECT
  $timeSeries as time,
  field1 AS speed,
  field2 AS direction
FROM table
WHERE $timeFilter
ORDER BY time
```

# Development

Install:

```sh
$ npm install
```

To run the watch server (automatic build on source changes) we use entr,
because the rollup watch server does not handle changes to html or css files.

Use make:

```sh
$ make help
build:  build the source files, output to dist folder
watch:  run watch server, for automatic build on source changes
help:  show this help
```
